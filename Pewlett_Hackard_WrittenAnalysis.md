Summary
Based on the results from the analysis, a number of employees that are eligble for reitrement are senior staff and senior engineers. The total number 90,038 to address the silver tusunami
Are there enough qualitifed, retirement-ready employeees in the departments to mentor the next generation of employees? The number of senior roles to be filled is significantly larger than the number of mentors available. The mentors would have to manage a signficant number of employess in order for it "to be enough."  Two additional queries would be to analyze the number of managers by department (total) and those retiring to get a better understanding of the number of managers retiring to determine how best to allocate resources per department. I would query to see which departments have the highest and lowest turnover. This quantative data could be used to begin to gather qualitative data about the best/worst practices per department which will help determine the best way to allocate resources to address the silver tsuanmi.
